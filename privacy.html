            <h2>mission statement</h2>
            <p>at 1701 locust we take very much pride in the quality of our produce. that being said, for anything along the chain of command to tarnish the quality of our good would be obviously unneceptable and we will do anything in our power to prevent said tragedies. If you see anything out of the ordinary we beg you to speak up so that the oncoming diners that precede your visit can have a wonderful time as well. Thank you for your time and patience, -- digi </p>
            <h2>A word about us</h2>
            <p>
                undergoing a recent name change (formerly known as 'the prime rib'), we may strike a new or unanticipated namesake, approaching new clientel of all ages to enjoy the symbiosis of client and server. Regardless of our new name, we are serving the same steaks from the same distributors we have always made trade with, and continue to seek the best products for all of our customers. Thank you so much for considering the courageous quest of trying new things in our home city of philadelphia and we promise you will not be dissapointed. Thank you again for your time. -- digi
